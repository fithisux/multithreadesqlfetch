The business case, I have a number of SEGMNTS_NO (see config.py) that I would like to retrieve.

This can be done by creating TASKS (see config.py) number of parallel tasks.


We have 2 synthetic tests (see onfig.py)

QUERY1 -> if I have 11 tasks and 11 segments, the fetch will happen in approx 5 sec. If TASKS is 1 it will happen
in approx 55 secs.



QUERY2 -> if I have 11 tasks and 11 segments, the fetch will happen in approx 0.08367 sec. If I have 11 tasks and 11 segments
it will happen in 0.03618.

Problem!!!! Not 11 times faster, the times to fetch increased in the parallel query. Make 100 -> 10000 in QUERY2.
Things get worse!!.

Why?
